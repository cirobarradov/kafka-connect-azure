# Kafka Connect Azure Connector

kafka-connect-azure is a [Kafka Connector](http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#connect)
for copying data from Kafka into Azure Blobs.

# Development

To build a development version you'll need a recent version of Kafka as well as a set of upstream Confluent projects, which you'll have to build from their appropriate snapshot branch. See the [FAQ](https://github.com/confluentinc/kafka-connect-elasticsearch/wiki/FAQ) for guidance on this process.

You can build kafka-connect-azure with Maven using the standard lifecycle phases.
